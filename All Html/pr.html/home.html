            The SDB project was launched by the former Chief Minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel, after the laying the
            foundation stone for the construction of the complex, as well as of the Diamond Research and Mercantile
            City,<br> on
            15 February 2015. Though the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the construction progress, the pace was increased
            after restrictions were lifted. The overall structure of the complex was completed in May 2022,and the
            overall <br> construction was finished on 26 July 2023. It was officially declared as the world's largest
            office
            building, surpassing The Pentagon, by the Guinness World Records on 22 August 2023. It was supposed to be
            inaugurated by <br> Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2023, but due to some internal works pending,
            it
            was
            delayed, and was inaugurated and opened on 17 December 2023.

            <h3>
                <li>Structure</li>
            </h3>
            The building is located in the core of the Diamond Research and Mercantile City, an upcoming business
            district.
            It is spread across 14.38 hectares (35.54 acres) with availability of 61,000 square metres (660,000 square
            feet)
            built-up area. The bourse comprises nine interconnected towers, each with 15 floors, accommodating 4,200
            offices
            ranging from 28 square metres (300 square feet) to 700 square metres (7,500 square feet), out of which 2,700
            offices are with 300 sq.ft. area each in five towers, 900 offices with 500 sq.ft. area in one tower, 400
            offices
            with 1,000 sq.ft. area in another tower, and two towers offering 350 larger offices exceeding 1,000 sq.ft.
            area.
            The nine towers are connected with each other by a large, 22 km-long central corridor, with access to
            services
            and facilities similar to an airport terminal. There are nine Panchtattva courts in between the nine
            buildings,
            created as recreational and green spaces. There are 131 lifts, with a speed of three metres per second. It
            has a
            two-level underground parking space, capable of accommodating 4,500 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. All of the
            offices are centrally air-conditioned through a chilled water-cooling system. The building provides
            amenities
            such as conference halls, multi-purpose halls, restaurants, banks, and retail shops along with security
            plans.
            In addition, there is a dedicated custom clearance house for import and export of diamonds, a National
            Diamond
            Research Institute (NDRI), an international convention centre, international education facilities, and
            five-star
            hotels.The complex is a pre-certified green building by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC)
            because of its eco-friendly and sustainabity measures adopted to function itself,and is dubbed as the
            world's largest corporate building.

            Corporate affairs
            The complex will be a one-stop destination for over 65,000 diamond professionals, including cutters,
            polishers
            and traders. The building can house 4,200 traders from 175 countries, who will come to the complex to buy
            polished diamonds. This will employ over 150,000 people in Surat's diamond's industry, increasing the
            working
            number of people from the present 800,000 to near about 1 million. According to the Chairman of the SDB,
            Vallabhbhai Patel, it is estimated that a turnover of over ₹200,000 crore (US$25 billion) can bring in
            annually.

            Reception
            The bourse has received a lukewarm reception from diamond traders, as it is located on the outskirts of the
            city
            of Surat and has poor connectivity, when compared with the existing Bharat Diamond Bourse, located in the
            better-connected city of Mumbai.The SDB announced incentives for shifting diamond business to
            Surat.In order to boost connectivity, there needs to be worldwide connectivity with Surat, like the
            global diamond centres of Antwerp, Chicago and London, in order to establish its dominance out of Mumbai,
            and
            let firms enter without hesitation. The Surat Airport has been expanded to an international status, which
            was
            also inaugurated on the same day of the SDB's inauguration, and will help to fulfill this target.As of
            December 2023, out of 4,200 offices, 135 offices have been opened, out of which 26 offices are operated by
            Mumbai-based diamond firms.

        The Somanath temple (IAST: somanātha) or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in
        Gujarat, India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is the first among the twelve
        jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with
        estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about the 9th century CE.The
        temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism as Somnath nomenclature, but the
        "Prabhasa-Pattana" (Prabhas Patan) is mentioned as a tirtha (pilgrimage site), where this temple exists.For
        example, the Mahabharata in Chapters 109, 118, and 119 of Book 3 (Vana Parva), and Sections 10.45 and 10.78 of
        the Bhagavata Purana state Prabhasa to be a tirtha on the coastline of Saurashtra.

        The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders
        and rulers, notably starting with an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century.

        In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians and archaeologists of the colonial era actively studied
        the Somnath temple because its ruins showed a historic Hindu temple that was turning into an Islamic
        mosque.After India's independence, those ruins were demolished, and the present Somnath temple was
        reconstructed in the Māru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's
        reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel after
        receiving approval for reconstruction from Mahatma Gandhi. The reconstruction was completed in May 1951, after
        his death.

        The Dwarkadhish temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally spelled Dwarakadheesh, is a Hindu temple
        dedicated to Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish (Dvārakādhisha), or 'King of Dwarka'. The
        temple is located at Dwarka city of Gujarat, India, which is one of the destinations of Char Dham, a Hindu
        pilgrimage circuit. The main shrine of the five-storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat
        Mandir or Nija Mandir. Archaeological findings suggest the original temple was built in 200 BCE at the
        earliest.The temple was rebuilt and enlarged in the 15th–16th century.

        According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha,
        over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place). The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in
        1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th–16th century,[citation needed] in the Māru-Gurjara style.

        The temple became part of the Char Dham pilgrimage considered sacred by Hindus in India. Adi Shankara, the 8th
        century Hindu theologian and philosopher, visited the shrine. The other three being comprising Rameswaram,
        Badrinath and Puri. Even today a memorial within the temple is dedicated to his visit. Dwarakadheesh is the 98th
        Divya Desam of Vishnu on the subcontinent, glorified in the Divya Prabandha sacred texts.The temple is at an
        elevation of 12.19 metres (40.0 ft) above mean sea-level. It faces west. The temple layout consists of a
        garbhagriha (Nijamandira or Harigraha) and an antarala (an antechamber).However, the existing temple is
        dated to 16th century.

        Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan Gir, is a forest, national park, and wildlife
        sanctuary near Talala Gir in Gujarat, India. It is located 43 km (27 mi) north-east of Somnath, 65 km (40 mi)
        south-east of Junagadh and 60 km (37 mi) south-west of Amreli. It was established in 1965 in the erstwhile Nawab
        of Junagarh's private hunting area, with a total area of 1,410.30 km2 (544.52 sq mi), of which 258.71 km2 (99.89
        sq mi) is fully protected as a national park and 1,151.59 km2 (444.63 sq mi) as wildlife sanctuary.[1] It is
        part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion.

        The 14th Asiatic Lion Census 2015 was conducted in May 2015. In 2015, the population was 523 (27% up compared to
        previous census in 2010). The population was 411 in 2010 and 359 in 2005. The lion population in Junagadh
        District was 268 individuals, 44 in Gir Somnath District, 174 in Amreli District, and 37 in Bhavangar District.
        There are 109 males, 201 females and 213 cubs.

        Gir National Park is closed from 16 June to 15 October every year, throughout the monsoon season.

        In the 19th century, the rulers of Indian princely states used to invite the British colonists for hunting
        expeditions. At the end of the 19th century, only about a dozen Asiatic lions were left in India, all of them in
        the Gir Forest, which was part of the Nawab of Junagarh's private hunting grounds. British viceroys brought the
        drastic decline of the lion population in Gir to the attention of the Nawab of Junagadh, who established the
        sanctuary. Today, it is the only area in Asia where Asiatic lions occur and is considered one of the most
        important protected areas in Asia because of its biodiversity. The Gir ecosystem with its diverse flora and
        fauna is protected as a result of the efforts of the government forest department, wildlife activists and NGOs.
        It is now considered the jewel of Gujarat's ecological resources.
